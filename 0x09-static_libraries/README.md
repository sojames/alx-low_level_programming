#Static C Library.
In the C programming language, a static library is a compiled object file containing all symbols required by the main program to operate (functions, variables etc.) as opposed to having to pull in separate entities.
 Static libraries arenâ€™t loaded by the compiler at run-time; only the executable file need be loaded. Static library object files instead are loaded near the end of compilation during its linking phase.
This project is about creating a static C library named libholberton.a where the prefix lib and suffix .a are the requirement for creating a standard C library.
A header file was also ceated along side the library called holberton.h where the .h is the extension for a header file.
